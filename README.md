# CS408 - M4.2 Lab
    This project is getting us familiar with all the
    different html code that we have access to. Including
    footers, headers, articles etc. We will use these to format
    a simple web page for a learning more about bird watching.

## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called "index.html"
    
## Testing
    There is no tests for this project. As such there is no
    command to run them.

## More Info
    There is an extra folder "ExtraFiles" that is 
    in this repository. These files are the extra 
    pages that are in the site. Are they needed? No, 
    they are not. I simply made them because I was 
    breaking the project down while doing formating 
    and thus wanted to see them.

    You can also see the example formating in the the 
    folder "Example". This folder contains the css, 
    and the html code for all files in the example 
    format. Normal index, will be shown as custom.

## References / If needed

    The only source I used for this project was the
    reading that was provided to us. Just to make sure
    I could figure out how to do the nav bar. As that was
    what I had problems coding.
