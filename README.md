## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called Letter.html
    
## Testing
    There is no tests for this project. As such there is no
    command to run them.

## More Info
    There is an extra folder "ExtraFiles" that is in this repository. These files are the extra pages that are in the site. Are they needed? No, they are not. I simply made them because I was breaking the project down while doing formating and thus wanted to see them.
